NOTE - I'm currently switching to a different branch of the discord.py module, and I'm using it as an excuse to clean up some really old and gross code. I'm rewriting the whole bot from start to finish, so development is paralyzed for probably a week or so.

A Discord bot that performs a weird bunch of random functions. I started working on this project on 22 January 2018, but I waited nearly a year to make this repository. I run it from a Raspberry Pi in my bedroom. Code is in the ./bot directory.
